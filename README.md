## Introduction
Underage smoking and poverty… Do they relate two each other? Intuitively we can’t tell. It’s possible that teenagers in poor areas have less option of
    recreation and tobacco becomes the dominant one; It’s also reasonable that teenagers in poor areas are less likely to afford tobacco and hence they are
    more popular in richer areas. Having curiosity for those questions, we decide to do a data analysis on two distinct data frames containing youth smoking
    and poverty information, and hopefully could draw some useful insights and the end

## Background Information
 Our group has chosen two data sets, one with data regarding the rate of youth tobacco usage. The other has data about poverty rates. We will compare the data by state to make our observation and see if there is a correlation between poverty rates and youth smoking in 2017. The youth tobacco data set contains the percentage of smoking by states for different youth groups. There are features like gender, education level, smoking type and smoking frequency, which allows us to explore and ask a variety of questions about youth tobacco usage.The concept of poverty is simple - it is the number of people who fall below their state poverty line in terms of income. Ages 0-17 classify as youth, so we are studying youth poverty rates and counts by state.

## Why is this important?
This domain is worthy analyzing because it will help us understand the correlation between low-income students and their likelihood to develop smoking habits. We feel that by understanding this correlation, we can better understand if bad habits such as smoking are largely affected by socioeconomic status or not. This information might be crucial to anti-smoking marketing campaigns, so they know what type of ads to run in what places."

### Side Note
We looked at data from 1999-2017 in our report. We also had to remove certain states that were included in one data set and not the other, leading to a few states such as Nevada not being in our report.
